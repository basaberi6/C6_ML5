## 📦 Project Overview

This project aims to **predict the sales performance of a global superstore** based on  factors such as order date, shipping mode, customer segment, and product categories. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify key churn factors and help stores more accuractly predict future sales.

**Key objectives:**
- Data preprocessing and EDA 🔍
- Train/test multiple models 🧪
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall 📈
- Deploy the best model ✅

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3.10
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 🤖 Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- 📂 Jupyter Notebook
- 🌐 Streamlit (for optional demo)
