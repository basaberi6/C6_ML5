## 📦 Project Overview

This project aims to **predict a customer's spending** based on their age, annual income, region, and loyalty score. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify key churn factors and help businesses retain customers.

**Key objectives:**
- Data preprocessing and EDA 🔍
- Train/test multiple models 🧪
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall 📈
- Deploy the best model ✅

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3.10
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 🤖 Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- 📂 Jupyter Notebook
- 🌐 Streamlit (for optional demo)
